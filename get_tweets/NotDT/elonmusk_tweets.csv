elonmusk|b'@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today\xe2\x80\x99s Model S is far more refined than initial production.'
elonmusk|b'@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm'
elonmusk|b'@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.'
elonmusk|b'@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won\xe2\x80\x99t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.'

elonmusk|b'@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can\xe2\x80\x99t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll try.'
elonmusk|b'@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.'
elonmusk|b'@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3\xe2\x80\x99s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anything like this.'
elonmusk|b'@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3\xe2\x80\x99s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers'
elonmusk|b'@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.'

elonmusk|b'@zacharyj98 Good idea ...'

elonmusk|b'@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.'

elonmusk|b'@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this.

elonmusk|b'@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.'
elonmusk|b'What\xe2\x80\x99s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.'
elonmusk|b'It\xe2\x80\x99s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage '
elonmusk|b'@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes'
elonmusk|b'@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.'
elonmusk|b'@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.'

elonmusk|b'@existentialcoms That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass \xf0\x9f\x8e\xa9 \xe2\x80\xa6'

elonmusk|b'@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange \xe2\x80\xa6'

elonmusk|b'Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.'

elonmusk|b'@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis.

elonmusk|b'@TeslaP85D That is true. If someone says they are thinking about having kids, I always encourage them to do so.'
elonmusk|"b""It is total BS &amp; hurtful to claim that I told a guy to miss his child's birth just to attend a company meeting. I would never do that."""

elonmusk|b'For more info on Tesla Energy, check out press kit. $250/kWh for utility scale is the real kicker '
elonmusk|b'@bonnienorman Haha, awesome :)'

elonmusk|b'Rocket launch good, satellite in geo transfer orbit. Still so damn intense. Looking fwd to it feeling normal one day.'
elonmusk|b'Worth watching @ExMachinaMovie. The AI would be in the network, not the robot, but otherwise good.'
elonmusk|b'@bonnienorman New Roadster battery should complete safety validation by end of July, so likely available in August'
elonmusk|b'@andrewket @TeslaRoadTrip Wow!'
elonmusk|b'While the rocket does look rather tall &amp; tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response '
elonmusk|b'Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.'
elonmusk|b'@Aero4Real I only invest in companies I help found or to help a friend or a cause (no return expected for latter two)'
elonmusk|b'Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.'

elonmusk|b'Ok, looks like we got some killer footage from the chase plane. Big ocean, small ship. Posting vid shortly '
elonmusk|b'Looks like Falcon landed fine, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing '
elonmusk|b'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.'
elonmusk|b'3 mins to liftoff'
elonmusk|b'Launch window always tight when orbital synch needed. In this case, Space Station. For Earth-Sun gravity null point, moon was in the way.'
elonmusk|b'Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud'
elonmusk|b'Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.'

elonmusk|b'Major new Tesla product line -- not a car -- will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio on Thurs 8pm, April 30'
elonmusk|b'Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever.'
elonmusk|b'Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head'
elonmusk|b'Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather'
elonmusk|"b""Contrary to press reports, I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons."""

elonmusk|b'However, when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars, the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.'
elonmusk|b'To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.'
elonmusk|b'Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future, though, for non-commercial traffic.'

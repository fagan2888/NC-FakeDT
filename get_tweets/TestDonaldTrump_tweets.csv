Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI &amp; Russia?'
realDonaldTrump|b'This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE &amp; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!'
realDonaldTrump|b'With Spies, or \xe2\x80\x9cInformants\xe2\x80\x9d as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it\xe2\x80\x99s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or \xe2\x80\x9cJustice\xe2\x80\x9d contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem?'
realDonaldTrump|b'The Failing @nytimes quotes \xe2\x80\x9ca senior White House official,\xe2\x80\x9d who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, as saying \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.\xe2\x80\x9d WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources.'
realDonaldTrump|b'Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Korea...and if there was, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Thanks to very brave Teacher &amp; Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House. The great people of Utah are Celebrating!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.'
realDonaldTrump|b'Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!'
realDonaldTrump|b'We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.'
realDonaldTrump|b'...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....'
realDonaldTrump|b'Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x9d'
realDonaldTrump|b'Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won\xe2\x80\x99t let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!'
realDonaldTrump|b'To the @NavalAcademy Class of 2018, I say: We know you are up to the task. We know you will make us proud. We know that glory will be yours. Because you are WINNERS, you are WARRIORS, you are FIGHTERS, you are CHAMPIONS, and YOU will lead us to VICTORY! God Bless the U.S.A.! '
realDonaldTrump|b'On behalf of the American People, CONGRATULATIONS! We love you! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States @NavalAcademy in Annapolis, Maryland. Congratulations!\n\nGood luck. Godspeed. And ANCHORS AWEIGH! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!'
realDonaldTrump|b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.\xe2\x80\x9d Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!'
realDonaldTrump|b'The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an \xe2\x80\x9cInformant\xe2\x80\x9d who is paid a fortune and who \xe2\x80\x9csets up\xe2\x80\x9d way earlier than the Russian Hoax?'
realDonaldTrump|b'Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse. Full ceremony:  '
realDonaldTrump|"b'Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the ""Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.\xe2\x80\x9d Read more:  '"
realDonaldTrump|b'I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th. While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world... '
realDonaldTrump|b'It was my great honor to host a roundtable re: MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York. Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un. '
realDonaldTrump|b'Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men &amp; Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE'
realDonaldTrump|b'Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Great to be in New York for the day. Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now, lots of work to be done! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York. Keep up the great work! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release. Democrats must abandon their resistance... '
realDonaldTrump|b'Today on Long Island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS-13. I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union... '
realDonaldTrump|b'Thank you @SBAList! #SBAGala '
realDonaldTrump|b'WITCH HUNT!'
realDonaldTrump|b'There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.'
realDonaldTrump|b'Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.'
realDonaldTrump|b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign\xe2\x80\x9d No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!'
realDonaldTrump|b'Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends'
realDonaldTrump|b'SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!'
realDonaldTrump|b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Andrew Napolitano'
realDonaldTrump|b'Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!'
realDonaldTrump|b'@foxandfriends  \xe2\x80\x9cNew Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?\xe2\x80\x9d Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!'
realDonaldTrump|b'...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!'
realDonaldTrump|b'If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...'
realDonaldTrump|b'For the first time since Roe v. Wade, America has a Pro-Life President, a Pro-Life Vice President, a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals! '
realDonaldTrump|b'It was my honor to welcome @NASCAR Cup Series Champion @MartinTruex_Jr and his team to the @WhiteHouse yesterday! '
realDonaldTrump|b'Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the @WhiteHouse!\xf0\x9f\x87\xba\xf0\x9f\x87\xb8\xf0\x9f\x87\xb0\xf0\x9f\x87\xb7 '
